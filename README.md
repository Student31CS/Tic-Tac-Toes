# Tic-Tac-Toes
Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. Runs on Terminal


A beginner's project intended for practice using loops in C++.

Game starts with a small introduction and a coin toss to determine which player will go first. Rather than having 
a computer-generated opponent, this game is meant to be played by two users on the same machine. (It might be fun
later on to give a user the option to play against the computer.)

After the first player is determined, there as a small set of instructions for choosing the desired square. They are
numbered 1 - 9. 

The program utilizes a check_win() function to determine whether or not a player has three consecutive squares.

The program ends after one game. To play again, run the program again.
